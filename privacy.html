  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: 2025-01-01</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>HabitDaddy is designed to be private by default. We do not collect, sell, or share personal data. Your habits and related data are stored on your device.</p>

  <h2>Data we store on your device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Habits/tasks you create (titles, icons, schedules)</li>
    <li>Completion history and analytics (e.g., consistency index)</li>
    <li>Timer sessions and settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share it (e.g., by exporting screenshots or device backups).</p>

  <h2>Notifications</h2>
  <p>Notifications are scheduled on-device using iOS notification APIs. We do not use any server to send notifications. If all tasks are complete for the day, no additional reminders are scheduled until the next day, to avoid unnecessary alerts.</p>

  <h2>Widgets & Live Activities</h2>
  <p>Widgets and Live Activities display on-device data only. No third-party analytics or tracking is used.</p>

  <h2>Network requests</h2>
  <p>The app does not transmit your habit or analytics data to external servers. Links you choose to open (e.g., App Store, GitHub issues) are handled by the system browser or App Store and are subject to those services’ privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Website privacy (Support page)</h2>
  <p>The HabitDaddy website is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. We do not set cookies or run analytics. GitHub may collect basic logs as part of operating the service; see the GitHub Privacy Statement for details.</p>
 
  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete habits, history, and timers at any time within the app.</li>
    <li>You can disable notifications in iOS Settings → Notifications.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app removes all app data from your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is protected by iOS security features on your device (passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and device encryption). We do not operate servers storing your data.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. We will update the effective date above when we do.</p>
